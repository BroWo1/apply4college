# Essay Analysis API Implementation

This document explains the implementation of the OpenAI-powered essay analysis feature.

## Overview

The essay analysis feature uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to provide comprehensive feedback on college essays. It analyzes essays across multiple dimensions and provides actionable suggestions for improvement.

## Architecture

### 1. API Service (`src/api/essayAnalysis.js`)

The main API service that communicates with OpenAI:

- **analyzeEssayWithOpenAI()**: Comprehensive essay analysis
- **getEssayImprovementSuggestions()**: Focused improvement suggestions
- **checkEssayGrammar()**: Grammar and style checking

### 2. Composable (`src/composables/useEssayAnalysis.js`)

Vue composable that manages analysis state and provides reactive data:

- Handles loading states
- Manages analysis results
- Provides computed properties for UI
- Implements smart re-analysis logic

### 3. Integration (`src/pages/essay.vue`)

The essay editor page integrates the analysis features:

- Real-time analysis with debouncing
- Visual feedback and scoring
- Detailed category breakdown
- Actionable comments and suggestions

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis

The AI analyzes essays across four key dimensions:

- **Structure & Organization**: Flow, transitions, and essay structure
- **Voice & Authenticity**: Personal voice and genuine storytelling
- **Content & Relevance**: Prompt adherence and college-specific alignment
- **Grammar & Style**: Writing mechanics and clarity

### 2. Scoring System

- Overall score (0-100)
- Category scores (0-10)
- Profile alignment score (0-100)
- Color-coded feedback (success/warning/error)

### 3. Detailed Feedback

- Specific comments with line references
- Actionable improvement suggestions
- Strengths identification
- Grammar and style corrections

### 4. Manual Analysis

- Manual analysis triggered by clicking "Analyze" button
- Content change detection clears existing analysis  
- Minimum word count threshold (50 words)
- Error handling and fallback

## Usage

### Basic Analysis

```javascript
import { useEssayAnalysis } from '@/composables/useEssayAnalysis.js'

const { analyzeEssay, overallScore, categories } = useEssayAnalysis()

await analyzeEssay({
  content: 'Your essay content...',
  prompt: 'Essay prompt...',
  college: 'Target College',
  studentProfile: profileData
})
```

### Manual Analysis

Users can trigger analysis by clicking the "Analyze" button in the AI panel. Analysis will only run when:
- Essay content has at least 50 words
- A college is selected
- User manually clicks the analyze button

## API Key Management

The system uses the existing `apiKeyService.js` to securely manage OpenAI API keys:

- Server-side key retrieval with client authentication
- Local storage fallback
- Automatic caching with 1-hour expiration

## Error Handling

- Network errors are caught and displayed to users
- API rate limiting is handled gracefully
- Fallback to cached results when possible
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Performance Optimizations

- Manual analysis to prevent excessive API calls
- Smart content change detection
- Cached API keys
- Minimal word count thresholds

## Data Structure

### Analysis Result

```javascript
{
  overallScore: 85,
  profileAlignment: 78,
  categories: [
    {
      id: 'structure',
      title: 'Structure & Organization',
      score: 8,
      feedback: 'Clear structure with good flow...',
      suggestions: ['Add transition sentences...']
    }
  ],
  comments: [
    {
      type: 'suggestion',
      text: 'Consider adding more specific details...',
      line: 12
    }
  ],
  strengths: ['Strong personal voice', 'Compelling examples'],
  improvements: ['Better transitions', 'More specific details']
}
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys are never exposed to client-side code
- Server-side authentication required
- Rate limiting on API calls
- User input validation

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time collaboration features
- Essay version history
- Plagiarism detection
- College-specific prompts database
- Performance analytics
- Batch analysis for multiple essays

## Configuration

The system can be configured through:

- `ANALYSIS_DELAY`: Debounce delay (default: 3000ms)
- `MIN_WORD_COUNT`: Minimum words for analysis (default: 50)
- `CACHE_DURATION`: API key cache duration (default: 1 hour)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **API Key Not Available**: Check server configuration and authentication
2. **Analysis Fails**: Verify internet connection and API quota
3. **Slow Analysis**: Check essay length and server response times
4. **Missing Feedback**: Ensure all required fields are provided

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Open the essay editor
2. Select a college and enter a prompt
3. Write at least 50 words
4. Analysis should trigger automatically after 3 seconds
5. Check the AI panel for results

## Dependencies

- OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Vue 3 Composition API
- Existing apiKeyService.js
